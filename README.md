# AppliedNumericalMethods
i am good with calculators and all but Why calculate when you can code ;)

Applied Numberical Methods is borinnngg! And i am lazy.
I coded all the algorithms taught in ANM class with each step so i dont have to calculate(iterate on the calci - which btw is prone to errors)
Next time that the professor gives an assignment, feed in its values to my code and u get your assigment in seconds with all the steps printed out for u.
